Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is DAOlexa
===============================================================================================================================

I am a legal woman gone decentralized. üíª I started my blockchain journey when I joined a DAO in an operational role, and since then I was mainly focused on DAOs, understanding how they operate, their onchain and offchain challenges, and how to overcome them. Thanks to my legal education and involvement in DAOs, I have gained relevant experiences to support projects on their path to decentralization, help them establish a decentralized governance and operations roadmap, and build necessary frameworks with legal and compliance aspect. On the other hand, I consult legal and compliance professionals advising them on DAOs, and helping them understand the challenges of onchain governance and decentralization. I am also a teacher in Nuclio Digital school, where I teach DAOs, decentralization, governance, tokenization, and the regulatory DAO challenges.
