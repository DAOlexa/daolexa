Hi, nice to GH-meet you - I am Aleksa, aka DAOlexa!
===============================================================================================================================

A legal woman gone decentralized. 
I started my blockchain journey when I joined a DAO in an operational role, and since then I was mainly focused on DAOs, understanding how they operate, their onchain and offchain challenges, and how to overcome them. 
Thanks to my legal education and involvement in DAOs, I have gained relevant experiences to support projects on their path to decentralization, help them establish a decentralized governance and operations roadmap, and build necessary frameworks with legal and compliance aspect. On the other hand, I consult legal and compliance professionals advising them on DAOs, and helping them understand the challenges of onchain governance and decentralization. 
I am also an instructor in Nuclio Digital school, where I teach DAOs, decentralization, governance, tokenization, and the regulatory DAO challenges.
